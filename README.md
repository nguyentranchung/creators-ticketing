After installation, publish the config file:

Setup: Filament Panel Integration: 
The plugin integration code should be added to your main Filament admin panel provider file, which is typically located at:
Open your AdminPanelProvider.php file and modify the panel() method as shown below. You need to include the use statement for the plugin class and call TicketingPlugin::make() inside the ->plugins() array.

```
app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php
```
```
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;
use daacreators\CreatorsTicketing\TicketingPlugin; // Add this line

class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->default()
            // ... other panel configuration ...
            ->plugins([
                TicketingPlugin::make(), // Add the plugin call here
            ])
            // ... rest of the panel configuration ...
    }
}
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```
